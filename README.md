# Differential-Cryptanalysis

We have implemented a Substitution-Permutation network, a type of a Block Cipher and a basis for many modern day symmetric key encryption schemes.

This is a Python 2.7.15 implementation of the Differential Cryptanalysis on SPN's. The Differential Attack Algorithm is depicted as Algorithm 4.3 (Page 104) of "Cryptography: Theory and Practice" by Douglas R. Stinson. 
Upon reading the required section, it should be easy to understand the code.
